4.	Discuss your data â€“ classify and categorise your data (K4, S3)

Proposed Solution

2.	Why is your approach a good approach? What alternative approaches have you considered? (S15, DC)
3.	What is a list of tasks that need completing to implement your solution and how did you prioritise them?
4.	Where are you sourcing your data from? What data protection considerations have you made? How will your project be kept up to date as data changes? (K12, S1)

Implementation (S2, B4)

1.	Detail the tasks you completed to implement your solution. You do not need to share the full technical output, but you need to explain any code you do share.

6.	Did you present this work to stakeholders? What was the feedback? (S12, S7)
